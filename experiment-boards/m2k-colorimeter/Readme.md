# M2k Colorimeter Accessory Board

TODO colorimeter theory, usage

## PCBs

This project consists of 4 PCBs to be assembled:

1. The main board (`board-main/`), which plugs in to the m2k
2. The RGB LED riser board (`board-led/`). Depending on the configuration, one or two may be used.
3. The photodiode riser board (`board-photodiode/`). Two are required.
4. The cuvette holder board (`board-holder/`). One is required (mounted at the top). For additional support and alignment, another one may be mounted right on the main board. No electrical function, just mechanical. Adapted from the [CN0363
](https://analog.com/CN0363).

Each board has gerber and drill files in `board-.../gerbers` and also a PDF in this root folder.

TODO insert images of each of the boards, assembly diagrams.
