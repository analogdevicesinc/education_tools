LTspice https://www.analog.com/ltspice
-------
LTspice® is a high performance SPICE simulation software, schematic capture
and waveform viewer with enhancements and models for easing the simulation
of analog circuits. Included in the download of LTspice are macromodels for
a majority of Analog Devices switching regulators, amplifiers, as well as a
library of devices for general circuit simulation.

*.asc LTspice schematic.
*.cir LTspice external netlist input
*.lib LTspice model library subcircuits

If the simulation model is not found please update with the "Sync Release"
command from the LTspice "Tools" menu

These are covered under the LTspice License

It remains your responsibility to verify proper and reliable operation in the
actual application. Component substitution and printed circuit board layout
may significantly affect circuit performance or reliability. This circuit is
distributed to Analog Devices customers only for use with Analog Devices parts.

Fritzing https://fritzing.org/home/
--------
Fritzing is an open-source hardware initiative that makes electronics
accessible as a creative material for anyone. It allows users to document
their prototypes, share them with others, teach electronics in a classroom,
and layout and manufacture professional pcbs.
